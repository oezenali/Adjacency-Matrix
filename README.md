#Algorithm
Given a matrix representing cities and their adjacency relationships, the following steps are taken:

Data Preparation: Construct a matrix representing cities and their adjacency relationships.
Degree Calculation: Compute the degree of adjacency for each city.
Color Selection: Define a set of colors (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green) available for coloring each city.
Sorting and Assignment: Sort cities based on adjacency degrees and assign colors starting from the city with the highest degree.
Conflict Resolution: Check for color conflicts among adjacent cities and adjust color assignments accordingly.
